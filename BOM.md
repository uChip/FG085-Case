#FG085 Case & Hack Bill of Materials (BOM)

###Case (half-case, order 2 pieces)  
I have had luck ordering 3D prints from [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com) and [MakeXYZ](http://www.makexyz.com).  Shapeways is more expensive but produces a more finished looking print.  More specifically at MakeXYZ I have used a local printer, [Jimmy Fakhouri](http://www.makexyz.com/printer/jimmyjack11@yahoo.com?printer=2771debf5bc034849d631421dd2aa280), to make several cases now.  I can recommend him highly.  

###Case Screws (4)  
The top and bottom halves of the case are held together with four #4 flat-head sheet-metal screws.

###Back Panel (1)  
There are three options for the back panel.  
  1. Use the back panel included with the kit.  You will have to cut holes for the power and USB connectors if you want to add them.  
  2. Use the enclosed [.dxf file](https://github.com/uChip/FG085-Case/blob/master/BackPanel1pc.DXF) to order a back panel in 1/16" black acrylic from a laser cutting company such as [Pololu](http://www.customlasercutting.com/).  This part will fit in the enclosed case design.  
  3. Use the enclosed [.dxf file](https://github.com/uChip/FG085-Case/blob/master/BackPanel1pc.DXF) to order a back panel in 1/8" black acrylic from a laser cutting company such as [Pololu](http://www.customlasercutting.com/).  You will need to modify the case .stl file to make the channel that captures the back panel wide enough for the 1/8" acrylic.  

###Spacers (4)  
Digi-KEY #952-2313-ND HEX STANDOFF M3 BRASS 12MM  
Use these spacers instead of the ones included in the kit.  They go between the front panel and the PCB.  Use the screws included in the kit.  The screws that normally retain the back panel will now secure the PCB/front panel assembly into the case.  You will only be able to put in two screws in the case but is sufficient.

###Rubber Feet, stick-on (4)  
Digi-Key #SJ5003-0-ND BUMPER CYLINDRICAL 0.44" DIA BLK  

###USB pig-tail  
Note that although I used a plug/header to connect to the PCB, it would have also worked to just solder the ribbon cable directly to the board.

###Power pig-tail  
Note that although I used a plug/header to connect to the PCB, it would have also worked to just solder the wires directly to the board.  
  - Barrel Jack Connector, Panel Mount (1)  Digi-Key #CP-5-ND CONN 2.1MM JACK w/HARD PNL MNT
  - Wire (8" red, 8" black)  stranded, 24 AWG
