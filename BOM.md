FG085 Case & Hack Bill of Materials (BOM)
=========================================

Case (2 half-case pieces)  
----
I have had luck ordering 3D prints from [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com) and [MakeXYZ](http://www.makexyz.com).  Shapeways is more expensive but produces a more finished looking print.  More specifically at MakeXYZ I have used a local printer, [Jimmy Fakhouri](http://www.makexyz.com/printer/jimmyjack11@yahoo.com?printer=2771debf5bc034849d631421dd2aa280), to make several cases now.  I can recommend him highly.
